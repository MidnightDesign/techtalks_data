TechTalks Data repository
=========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MidnightDesign/techtalks_data.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MidnightDesign/techtalks_data)

TechTalks (working title - any suggestions?) aims to be a catalog for recordings of developer conference talks.

This repository is just the data, but you can find an example frontend at http://talks.dot1x.net/.
